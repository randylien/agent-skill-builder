# Claude Code Skill Builder

Based on Claude Code’s [Agent Skills document](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview), generate the corresponding SKILL.md file and related artifacts such as REFERENCE.md and the scripts folder.


## Best practices for Skill authors
- One Skill, one purpose: Don't create mega-Skills
- Specific descriptions: Include trigger words users will say
- Clear instructions: Write for Claude, not humans
- Concrete examples: Show real code, not pseudocode
- List dependencies: Mention required packages in description
- Test with teammates: Verify activation and clarity
- Version your Skills: Document changes in content
- Use progressive disclosure: Put advanced details in separate files
